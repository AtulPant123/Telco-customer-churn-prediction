# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The goal is to identify which customers are at risk of leaving the service, understand the underlying reasons, and help the business take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Domain**: Telecom / Subscription-based services  
- **Objective**: Predict whether a customer will churn (`Yes` or `No`)  
- **Data**: Realistic telecom customer data with service, demographic, and billing information  
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTE

## 📊 Methodology  
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE  
- Training and tuning the XGBoost model  
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  

## 🔍 Results  
The final model achieves strong performance in identifying customers at risk of churn. Key evaluation metrics and visualizations can be found in the notebook under the `assets/` folder.
